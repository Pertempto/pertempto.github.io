      Do <b>not</b> pry until you have very carefully used heat and tool to
      break seal. The glass <b>will</b> crack if you pry without breaking the
      seal.

      I got by using a plastic triangle pry tool and flat head screwdriver to
      break the seal. Didn't need the metal tool mentioned in the video.

      My mac had a <b>ton</b> of dust inside it. I'm going to try just cleaning
      out at first to see if that fixes it without replacing PSU. I took the PSU
      out and blew it off with the air compressor - it was especially coated in
      dust.
    </p>
    <p>My PSU was an ADP-300AF T</p>
    <p>
      It ran all night with no problems, but then died within half an hour of
      trying to actually run applications on it.
    </p>
    <p>I ordered a new PSU on Ebay for about $25.</p>
