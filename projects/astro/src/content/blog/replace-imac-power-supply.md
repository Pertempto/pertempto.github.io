Watch this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2jq5UbIr_g) for background.

Do *not* pry until you have very carefully used heat and tool to break seal. The glass *will* crack if you pry without breaking the seal.

I got by using a plastic triangle pry tool and flat head screwdriver to break the seal. Didn't need the metal tool mentioned in the video.

My mac had a *ton* of dust inside it. I tried just cleaning it out at first to see if that fixed it without replacing the PSU. I took the PSU out and blew it off with the air compressor - it was especially coated in dust.

My PSU is an ADP-300AF.

It ran all night with no problems, but then died within half an hour of trying to actually run applications on it.

I ordered a new PSU on Ebay for about $25.
