# Why I Chose Helix

Recently I got all my devices switched over to Pop!_os, and I absolutely love it. Some of my favorite things are the system-wide launcher and the window management keyboard shortcuts. Increasingly, I can use the keyboard where I used to use the mouse - resulting in much greater efficiency with how I interact with my computers. It has been a **huge** upgrade over Windows 11.

This new passion for running things from a keyboard has made me more and more disatisifed with VS Code and it's mouse-based workflows. Sure, I could optimize my setup to learn more of the built-in keyboard shortcuts and create a few extras where I need them; but do I really want to lock myself into a [Microsoft product](https://ghuntley.com/fracture/) for one of the core parts of my career - editing text files? My answer was no. I would much rather setup my workflows around open source tools with thriving communities.

This of course led me to NeoVim. I tried using it several times, but it was very intimidating and overwhelming to get started. It seemed that I would need to install several plugins to get a useful environment setup, and that was too much of an investment for me to get started.

I heard of Helix several times in online forums, so I decided to install it and see what is was like.

My favorite thing - it works great right out of the box. I don't love the default theme, but it's trivial to customize a few things and have a very useful development environment ready to go.

Many people online say that NeoVim is much better because of the plugins - they complain about Helix's lack of plugin support. So far, I've found the lack of plugins to be a strength, not a weakness. Helix is somewhat Vim-compatible with a lot of the basic motions, but they aren't bound to backwards-compatability like NeoVim is. The base editor is useful out of the box, which isn't really the case for NeoVim. This is a sentiment I saw repeated multiple times across the different forums. There really is something to be said for software that **just works**.

I'm starting out slow with Helix. For now I've only used it for editing Markdown. This has allowed me to get comfortable with the bare basics of commands/motions without drowning in the learning curve. We'll see how my perspective changes when I transition to writing actual code with it. From what I've read it's not too hard to configure language servers, so I'm pretty optimistic.

Hopefully I can eradicate VS Code from my workflows in the near future! It's one more step on the journey of embracing a workflow built on truly free and open source software.
