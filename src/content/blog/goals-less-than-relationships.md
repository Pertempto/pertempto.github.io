## My Background With Goals

I am a very goal-oriented person.

I have many goals for many different timeframes. Short term goals for today and this week. Medium term goals for the next few months. Long term goals for next few years or decades. I'm good at overwhelming myself with goals.

Often, I allow my personal goals to become an idol in my life, distracting myself from far more important things. The desire to make progress on my goals can very easily get in the way of relationships. I tell myself that these goals will eventually allow me to invest in my relationships in a much greater way in the future, but in doing so, I miss out on investing in relationships today. Who says I will even be here to invest in relationships in a few years? As a [wise man](https://biblehub.com/james/4-14.htm) was inspired to say, "You do not even know what will happen tomorrow! What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes."

Satan wants us to chase joy in the future so that we miss out on the joy available to us today. How often I fall into his trap!

## The Value of Relationships

Investing in strong relationships **must always** be a higher priority than seeking to achieve our personal goals. I firmly believe there is no better way to invest time than in relationships, yet my daily life often fails to reflect this belief.

Jesus was once asked about our greatest goals in life. A man wanted to know what our ultimate goal in life should be.

> Now one of the scribes had come up and heard their debate. Noticing how well Jesus had answered them, he asked Him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?”  
> Jesus replied, “This is the most important: ‘Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ No other commandment is greater than these.”
> [Mark 12:28-31](https://biblehub.com/bsb/mark/12.htm)

Jesus gave a rather simple answer. Our greatest goal in life should be to pursue relationship with God with everything we've got. Our second-greatest goal in life should be to pursue relationship with our fellow man, to the point that we love others as much as we love ourselves.

## Introspection

Time is one of the most valuable resources God has blessed us with. Are we stewarding it well?

If I go through life chasing personal goals and even achieve many of them at the cost of my relationships with God and my fellow man, what have I truly achieved? What is the point of achieving so many lesser goals if I miss out on achieving the two greatest goals of life? This would be terrible stewardship of the time God has blessed me with.

On the other hand, if I go through life and fail to achieve many of my personal goals but build strong relationships with my God and with my fellow man, what have I truly lost? My lesser goals are so insignificant compared to these two greater goals.

May God grant us daily wisdom to keep our goals in the right order!
