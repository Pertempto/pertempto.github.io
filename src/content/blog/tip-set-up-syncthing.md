## Background

## Steps


## Future Possibilities

This is only the beginning of what you can do with Syncthing.

Here are a few of the things I want to explore further.
- Set up Syncthing with related tooling on Android in order to sync files to your mobile devices.
- Integrate with a Tailnet in order to sync your devices remotely, even when you aren't at home.
- Syncing configuration files between your different Linux devices.
